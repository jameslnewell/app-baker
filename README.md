# tradie

A semi-opinionated build tool for frontend projects. Use it to lint, bundle and test your script and style files.

> Warning: This project is still experimental! Please [report any issues](https://github.com/jameslnewell/tradie/issues).

## Installation

    npm install -g tradie

## Usage

1. Create your project with:

    `tradie init`

2. Build your project with:

    `npm run build`

3. Test your project with:

    `npm run test`

## Tasks

### Initialise

Create a new project.

    tradie init --force --template=tradie-template-react

Uses conventions to create a new project.

Use the `--force` flag to write to disk.

### Clean

Delete bundled script and style files.

    tradie clean

### Linting

Lint script files.

    tradie lint

Uses `eslint` to lint script files.

### Bundling

Bundle script and style files.

    tradie bundle --watch --verbose
    # OR
    tradie bundle-scripts --watch --verbose
    tradie bundle-styles --watch --verbose

Uses `browserify` and `sass-composer` to bundle script and style files. Browserify transforms and plugins may be specified in your `.tradierc` file. Styling rules are `autoprefix`ed.

Use the `--watch` flag to re-bundle script and style files whenever they change.

Set `NODE_ENV=production` to minify script and style files e.g. `cross-env NODE_ENV=production tradie build`

### Building

Lint and bundle script and style files with a single command.

    tradie build --watch --verbose

Performs the linting and bundling steps listed above.

### Testing

Test script files.

    tradie test --watch

There's no need to setup extensions or compilers for `mocha`, this command bundles all your test files (`*.test{.js,.jsx,etc`) using your `browserify` transforms/plugins, then runs the generated test bundle with `mocha`.

Mocha options may be configured in a `.mocharc` file:

```json
{
  "reporter": "spec",
  "timeout": 2000,
  "ui": "bdd",
  "colors": true,
  "require": []
}
```

Use the `--watch` flag to re-test script files whenever they change.

## Configuration

### Scripts

Configure script bundling.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "src": "src/", //the directory where script files are sourced
    "dest": "dist/", //the directory where bundled scripts are output
    "bundles": ["index.js"], //the script entry files
    "libraries": [], //the third-party packages placed into `vendor.js` for long term caching
    "transforms": [], //the browserify transform
    "plugins": [], //the browserify plugins
    "externals": [], //the browserify externals
    "extensions": [".js"] //the script extensions
  }
}
```

### Tests

Configure test-specific bundling overrides. These settings are merged with the `scripts` configuration.

```json
{
  "tests": {
    "externals": ["react", "react-dom"]
  }
}
```

### Styles

Configure style bundling.

```json
{
  "styles": {
    "src": "src/", //the directory where style files are sourced
    "dest": "dist/", //the directory where bundled styles are output
    "bundles": ["index.scss"] //the style entry files
  }
}
```

### Plugins

Configure tradie plugins.

```json
{
  "plugins": []
}
```

For example:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "tradie-plugin-livereload", // OR
    "livereload", // OR
    ["tradie-plugin-livereload", {"scripts": false}]
  ]
}
```

## Change log

### 0.8.2-3

- fix: report UglifyJS errors with more detail, and still output the scripts

### 0.8.0

- add: made browserify `externals` configurable via `scripts.externals`
- add: specify additional test config when running tests

### 0.7.10

- fix: dist-tags went wrong and npm is showing the wrong readme

### 0.7.8-9

- fix: CSS minification

### 0.7.5-7

- fix: use the full relative bundle path when creating the bundle output

### 0.7.4

- fix: case-sensitive issues on linux

### 0.7.0

- fix: bug with bundling for node - `incremental-browserify` seems to force it to be bundled for the browser
- fix: bug with linting attempting to lint the `package.json` file after `watchify` reports it as changed
- fix: bug with bundles targeting for nodejs shouldn't exclude vendor libs because there's no way to include them like on the client'
- fix: bug with script/style build times - was reporting sum of times instead of reporting the largest time
- fix: bug with tests - the test bundler was not using extensions configured by the user
- fix: bug with tests - the test bundler was bundling for the browser, not node where they're being run
- add: if a script entry point is named `server.js` then it is bundled to run on nodejs

### 0.6.3

- fix: added missing deps to `package.json`

### 0.6.1

- fix: don't use `String.startsWith()` cause node v4

### 0.6.0

- break: template/plugin names starting with `@` will no longer be prefxed with `tradie-template`/`tradie-plugin` in order
to allow privately scoped templates/plugins

### 0.5.3

- fix: incorrect plugin doco

### 0.5.2

- fix: emitting the wrong event when a style bundle errored which meant the error wasn't displaying

### 0.5.1

- fix: linter wasn't using script extensions
- fix: init command would fail if there was an existing `.tradierc` file that had an error in it

### 0.5.0

- add: ability to pass in `mocha` options via `.mocharc` file
- fix: made bundling of tests more reliable, but slower by not using `browserify-incremental`
- fix: while watching with the build command, linting failures were preventing the bundle from being built (and watching starting) and linting was not re-run on change

### 0.4.0

- add: ability to write templates for initialising tradie
- add: started writing unit-tests for tradie

### 0.3.0

- add: ability to write plugins for extending tradie
- break: large refactoring of the "API"

### 0.2.0

- add: make script extensions configurable
- add: allow environment specific configuration (like in `.babelrc` files)
- add: allow `browserify` plugins

## To do

- do we need to lint all files on re-bundle while watching? test files aren't watched so it makes it hard to check linting of test files. maybe we need to add a watch arg to the lint command that watches everything, not just what's being bundled
- resolve `eslint` configs relative to the current working dir
- handle errors on browserify object (not just the bundle)
- make/find cache-bust and image optimisation CLIs
- `npm install` after init
- finish writing unit and integration tests
- make a hmr plugin
- make `autoprefixer` configurable
- make `uglify` configurable
- make `sass-composer` configurable
- make a code-splitting example
